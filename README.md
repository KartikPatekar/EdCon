This project generates structured, diagnostic performance reports for JEE Advanced mock tests using student test data.
Instead of focusing only on scores, the system analyses topic-wise performance, conceptual difficulty handling, and decision-making patterns.
Each report provides targeted, skill-level feedback and study guidance tailored to the student’s performance profile.
The goal is to convert test data into actionable academic insights rather than generic evaluations.
